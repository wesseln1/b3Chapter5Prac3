## Practice: Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam

### Learning Objective: Practice accessing data within an array of objects

#### You have been tasked with building a list of email addresses of all of our customer's contacts so we can spam them with an email about Miffles the Vampire Weiner Dog.

##### 1. Create a new project in workspace.
##### 2. In your JavaScript file, paste the customers array that contains the emails we need to retrieve.
##### 3. From that array, extract just the customers' contact email addresses and store them in a new array. You will need a nested array method - meaning one iteration inside another one - since you need to iterate the entire array of customers, and then iterate the array of emails for each one.
